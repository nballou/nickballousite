abstract: "Open science is a movement that is transcending disciplines. As a legal scholar engaged in empirical research, I have adopted many good practices from other fields that have engaged with the need to enhance transparency, reproducibility and credibility at an earlier stage. I believe that open science should be a continued dialogue between disciplines, and that we can all learn from each other. As I have learned to publicly share data and analysis scripts, preregister my hypotheses, and conduct studies using the registered report format from other disciplines, I believe that others can adopt at least one good practice from the legal discipline (which is also conventionally crucial to the methods of many humanities disciplines).  It is very simple: provide page numbers for references cited in-text."
