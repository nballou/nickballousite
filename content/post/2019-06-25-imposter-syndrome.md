After some significant struggles with my own mental health, I am quite empathetic to the struggles of others. 

For some reason, however, my empathy has a few blind spots. One I've been working on recently is imposter syndome. 

There is one scholar in field closely related to mine who is, pardon my Uzbek, fucking killing it. She's published multiple times in the fields top journals, she'll complete her PhD by age 25 and will be joining one of the world's best universities as a fellow shortly after graduation. She does an incredible job with science communication and outreach.

And although her experience of imposter syndrome doesn't fully resemble mine, she still describes something akin to feeling as though she is behind relative to her peers, that she hasn't done enough or isn't doing it quickly enough. 

My initial reaction when I hear that is one of mild anger. The idea that she is behind relative to anyone is patently absurd; she's one of the most accomplished scholars at this career stage on the planet, with a CV that I legitimately think some people might be willing to murder for. And I'm sure she knows that too, so of all people, why would she ever feel like an imposter?

That, however, is precisely the point. There is no set of life conditions that give or deny permission for someone to have a particular psychological reaction. I learned this myself rather painfully. 

This experience of jealousy and gatekeeping has made me think for the first time in a long time about my experience in the psychiatric hospital. Things had collapsed for me after the end of a relationship that, in retrospect, was a long time coming and should've ended even earlier. Somehow, I managed to get blind-sided by this, and the host of psychological problems that I had been keeping at bay hit me at once.

I was in a very different position to the other patients at the hospital. People there were dealing with situations I couldn't even fathom: estrangement from children, drug addiction, homelessness, PTSD, and more. In comparison, I was a honors student at a private university who had a relatively strong social network, support (both emotional and financial) from my parents, and plenty of time to figure out what I wanted in future. 

Overall, people were kind, but I did notice hints of resentment. I felt the need to defend myself at one point, saying "everyone here is dealing with the most difficult thing they've ever had to deal with—whatever that is for them, this is what it is for me and I just want it to be over." It was tentative though; I didn't really believe it. I felt tremendously childish for letting something so relatively small land me in the hospital. Group therapy, which is a odd experience even on the best days, gave me anxiety, as I didn't want to respond to the same questions again, saying when it was my turn "I'm here because of the end of a long-term relationship". 

Over time, I have gotten past this. I'm comfortable discussing my mental health history, even on a ostensibly public platform like this with some risk of alienating people who have not themselves experienced mental health issues (hopefully none of these alienated people are potential employers!). 

The takeaway point is this: if one can feel imposter syndrome inside of a psychiatric hospital, anyone can feel it. I'm working on accepting my own imposter-like feelings as they appear, making sure they neither stop be from celebrating the successes of others and nor prevent me from recognizing that even the most talented among us can have crises of confidence.
