</br ></br > Welcome! I’m a psychologist researching how technology affects health---for example, effects like stress relief, displacement, and nostalgia. I develop creative methods to collect detailed behavioral data from digital media platforms (e.g., Xbox, TikTok), and use this data to develop new strategies for parents and users to build healthy relationships with technology.

Because much of the most informative data is held by industry, I have negotiated non-financial, tightly scoped collaborations with companies (e.g., Nintendo) to enable data access, while retaining full academic independence and transparency.

A broader goal of my work is to make psychological research more trustworthy and causally-oriented as part of the [science reform](https://nickballou.com/openscience) movement. These efforts extend to developing guidelines for minimizing bias in industry collaborations. 

I'm a [Huo Family Foundation Early Career Fellow](https://huofamilyfoundation.org/news/updates/huo-family-foundation-awards-17-6m-for-groundbreaking-research/) and [Imperial College Research Fellow](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/research-and-innovation/research-office/funder-information/research-fellowships/icrf/) at Imperial's Dyson School of Design Engineering). 

Feel free to <a href="#contact">contact me</a> about anything related to technology, mental health, disordered play, or similar topics---or perhaps if you just need a recommendation for your next game.
