</br ></br > Welcome! I’m a psychologist and lifelong video game player researching how media use affects health---for example, effects like stress relief, displacement, and nostalgia. I develop creative methods to collect detailed behavioral data from platforms (e.g., Xbox, TikTok) and occasionally form non-financial partnerships with companies (e.g., Nintendo) to access their data.

A broader goal of my work is to make psychological research more trustworthy and causally-oriented as part of the [science reform](https://nickballou.com/openscience) movement.

I'm a postdoc at the [Oxford Internet Institute](https://www.oii.ox.ac.uk/people/profiles/nick-ballou/), having recently finished my PhD at Queen Mary University of London.<sup><abbr title="Supervised in the former by the inimitable Andy Przybylski, and in the latter by the wonderful team of Sebastian Deterding, David Zendle, and Laurissa Tokarchuk."><small><small><i class="fas fa-heart"></i></small></small></abbr></sup> 

<!---
In my PhD, I'm supervised by a delightful team: [Prof Sebastian Deterding](https://codingconduct.cc/Publications), [Dr David Zendle](https://pure.york.ac.uk/portal/en/researchers/david-zendle(127e6f28-98bb-4662-a759-369391c609e6)/publications.html), and [Dr Laurissa Tokarchuk](http://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/~laurissa/Laurissas_Pages/About_Me.html).

In my postdoc, I work with [Prof Andy Przybylski](https://www.oii.ox.ac.uk/people/profiles/andrew-przybylski/) to understand how video games affect mental health.
