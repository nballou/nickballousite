We tested the questionnaire in a series of 5 studies with 1246 participants (some of whom completed the questionnaire multiple times) to see if it measured what we think it measured, and whether the statistical properties hold up to scrutiny. 

I hope to summarize this more succinctly at a future date---in the meantime, please see the preprint for details.
