# The Scale

The Basic Needs in Games (BANGS) is an open-access, free to use scale. You can use it to understand how players experience a game or gaming in general. However, to ensure good measurement and fair comparisons, it is important to use the scale as devised. 

Below, we provide a few tips. This is not meant to be guide on how to conduct surveys or how to perform statistical analysis of results. For more general information on conducting survey studies, I point you in the direction of a few useful resources at the bottom of this page.

If you are comfortable with player experience measurement, quick-start templates can be found here [Excel file](https://nickballou.com/files/BANGS.xlsx).

# How to use

## What order should the items be in?

We strongly recommend randomizing the order in which items appear. This allows you to better use multiple items to measure the same underlying thing (i.e., the three autonomy satisfaction items) without it being overly obvious or tedious for participants who would have to otherwise fill out several similar items in a row.

## What are the response options?

BANGS was designed using a 7-pt Likert scale with the following format: 

<style type="text/css">
.tg  {border-collapse:collapse;border-spacing:0;margin:0px auto;}
.tg td{border-color:black;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;
  overflow:hidden;padding:10px 5px;word-break:normal;}
.tg th{border-color:black;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;
  font-weight:normal;overflow:hidden;padding:10px 5px;word-break:normal;}
.tg .tg-063u{background-color:#ffffff;border-color:#000000;color:#333333;text-align:center;vertical-align:bottom};

</style>
<table class="tg">
<thead>
  <tr>
    <td class="tg-063u" width="13%"><span style="font-weight:400;font-style:normal;text-decoration:none;color:black">1 - Strongly</span> <br><span style="font-weight:400;font-style:normal;text-decoration:none;color:black">disagree</span></td>
    <td class="tg-063u" width="13%"><span style="font-weight:400;font-style:normal;text-decoration:none;color:black">2</span></td>
    <td class="tg-063u" width="13%"><span style="font-weight:400;font-style:normal;text-decoration:none;color:black">3</span></td>
    <td class="tg-063u" width="13%"><span style="font-weight:400;font-style:normal;text-decoration:none;color:black">4 - Neither agree</span> <br><span style="font-weight:400;font-style:normal;text-decoration:none;color:black">nor disagree</span></td>
    <td class="tg-063u" width="13%"><span style="font-weight:400;font-style:normal;text-decoration:none;color:black">5</span></td>
    <td class="tg-063u" width="13%"><span style="font-weight:400;font-style:normal;text-decoration:none;color:black">6</span></td>
    <td class="tg-063u" width="13%"><span style="font-weight:400;font-style:normal;text-decoration:none;color:black">7 - Strongly</span> <br><span style="font-weight:400;font-style:normal;text-decoration:none;color:black">agree</span></td>
  </tr>
</thead>
</table>

In one study, we tested an alternative format where the numeric values were changed to range from -3 to +3, instead of 1 to 7. We did not find any evidence that this affected the validity of the measure, so if you feel this better represents your goals with measuring basic needs, this is an alternative option. However, because the majority of our research used a 1 to 7 scale, the -3 to +3 variant should be used with some caution. 

## How do you fill in the blanks?

BANGS was tested for three kinds of usage:

- Experiences of a particular game session
- Experiences of a particular game over time
- Experiences of gaming in general over time

It's important to be explicit about which of these you are interested in, and measure appropriately. For each, you will need to update the stem text and the placeholder [X]s in each item to suit the context. The table below summarizes the changes you'll need to make. Fully-updated variants are available in the [Excel file](https://nickballou.com/files/BANGS.xlsx).

## Scoring

If possible, we recommend calculating factor scores based on players' responses to each item, or using a measurement model---this allows you to account for the fact that each item gives a different amount of information about the underlying construct. [Research shows](https://doi.org/10.3758/s13428-022-01849-w) that these scores typically differ somewhat from simply taking the mean of each subscale, and that this can have an appreciable impact on your results. 

If this is not feasible or convenient, we recommend simply using the mean of all items in each subscale (e.g., the mean of items 1, 2, and 3 for autonomy satisfaction; items 4, 5, and 6 for autonomy frustration, and so on).

Depending on your research interests, it may be appropriate to calculate the mean of all the need satisfaction items (i.e., satisfaction of autonomy, competence, and relatedness) and the mean of all need frustration items (i.e., frustration of autonomy, competence, and relatedness) as holistic indications of people's overall need satisfaction and frustration. Note, however, that this will result in the loss of information about which needs are more satisfied or frustrated. 

We do not recommend calculating a score of all 18 items together (e.g., subtracting the mean of all need frustration items from the mean of all need satisfaction items)---need satisfaction and frustration are separate constructs with different consequences, and are therefore best handled separately.

<!-- # How to apply BANGS -->

<!-- - Step 1 - Get familiar -->
<!-- - Step 2 - Respect the validation -->
<!-- - Step 3 - Respect the measurement -->
<!-- - Step 4 - Scale distribution -->
<!-- - Step 5 - When to measure -->
<!-- - Step 6 - Shuffle the times -->

<!-- ## Step 1. Get familiar with the scale and PX as a multidimensional construct -->

<!-- The PXI theorizes player experience as a "multidimensional construct", meaning that it contains 10 different constructs to measure different aspects of the player experience. Each of the constructs comes with three items (~similar questions that measure this aspect of the game). -->

<!-- Five constructs (15 items) poll for player experience at the functional level, as the direct, immediate experience during gameplay. These constructs are: Ease of control, Progress feedback, Audiovisual appeal, Clarity of goals and rules and Challenge. -->

<!-- Five constructs (15 items) poll for player experience at the psychosocial level, these are the indirect, emotional experiences derived from playing the game. These constructs are: Mastery, Curiosity, Immersion, Autonomy and Meaning. -->

<!-- Each construct comes with three items. An item is a statement such as "Playing the game was meaningful to me". The construct "Mastery" for example, is measured by the three items "I felt a sense of mastery playing this game", "I felt I was good at playing this game", "I felt capable while playing the game". Note that these items are deliberately very similar, yet they are not identical. But basically, you are asking a participant to evaluate mastery three times. In this manner, you ensure that you have a reliable measurement. When computing your overall score, you can then use the average of the three items. -->

<!-- ## Step 2. Respect the validation -->

<!-- The scale is validated as it is, you cannot make changes to it. This means that if you remove constructs or if you reword items, you are no longer using a validated scale. You have now created your own variant of the scale. This can be fine for your purpose and if this is what you want and need, you are free to do so. But realise you are no longer using a validated scale, and you can no longer compare your data to the benchmark data. -->

<!-- Note that these items are purposefully designed. For example, we intentionally avoided negatively phrased items, and also tried to have short statements. Designing "good" items may seem trivial, but it is not. They also have been tested with participants, over several studies. Many items for the PXI have been removed because participants interpreted them in different ways. -->

<!-- It is fine to add additional questions to the survey, though. (The PXI scale can be part of your survey). For example, while not part of the validated scale, you may consider to add items to measure an overall sense of enjoyment derived from playing the game. This is not a problem. And of course, in your survey you can poll for additional things such as demographic information or specific details about the game. -->

<!-- ## Step 3. Respect the measurement -->

<!-- Each construct is measured via a 7-point Likert, from -3 to +3 scale over 0, accompanied by the labels (Strongly disagree, Disagree, Slightly disagree, Neither disagree, neither agree, Slightly agree, Agree, Strongly agree). Respecting this measurement via 7-point Likert scale and via these labels (Disagree-Agree) is important. If you decide to use a 5-point Likert scale, if you decide to ask to measure items using a thumbs up or thumbs down, or if you use labels like (totally unhappy to totally happy), then again you are no longer using the validated PXI scale. You have again created your own variant. -->

<!-- We also strongly promote using a scoring from -3 to +3 with a neutral 0. The 0 here is meaningful, as the outcome of the scale also gives you information on whether the different constructs of the player experience score are rather positive or rather negative. For participants, it is easier to grasp the meaning of -1 (on a scale of -3 to +3), than a 3 (on a scale from 1 to 7). -->

<!-- While you do not need to add the numbering/ labels for every item, it should always be clear what number or label is associated with which scoring. -->


<!-- Items of the PXI should be measured via a 7-point Likert, from 1 ("Strongly disagree"),  7 scale over, accompanied by the labels (Strongly disagree to Strongly agree) -->


<!-- ## Step 5. Decide on when to measure -->

<!-- The BANGS scale  -->

<!-- ## Step 6. Randomize the order of  items -->

<!-- Ensure that you shuffle both (1) the order of the various scales in your study and (2) the order of items within each scale. This helps ensure that any biases that arise from people filling out one scale before another are balanced out over the course of the study, or from filling out several similar items in a row.  -->


<!-- # A final note -->
<!-- Making use of the scale is free, but ask that you cite the source for the scale.  -->

<!-- Additionally, as part of a larger open data movement and as part of helping to grow the games user research community, consider adding your (of course anonymized) data to the benchmark PXI data set. Reach out to us, if you consider doing this. In this case, we would like you to also ask for the birth year and gender, and provide a name, description of the game as well as a game genre. Template forms in different formats are available for preview and download above. You can use these forms to collect data from the participants. -->
