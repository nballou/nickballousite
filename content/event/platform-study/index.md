Oxford is currently undertaking a study on video game behavior and wellbeing. The study is being conducted by the Oxford Internet Institute, and is funded by the UK's Economic and Social Research Council. The principle investigator of the study is Prof. Andrew K. Przybylski. Project details and some examples of our previous work can be found on our [project page](https://www.oii.ox.ac.uk/research/projects/understanding-video-game-play-and-mental-health/). 

Participants in the study consent to share objective behavioral data from one or more video game platforms that they use, such as Nintendo Switch, Xbox, or Steam, and to complete wellbeing surveys over time. 

If you are interested in participating in a future iteration of this study, please share your email address [in this survey](https://oii.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_1Lb5o7F3RHhQ2Ue). Your email will not be used for any other purpose than to invite you to participate in the study should space become available.
